```{r, include = TRUE}

--> command option i will automatically put an r chunk in your code 
--> command shift m will make a pipe

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Loading required packages

For the following analyses we will require the use of a number of different R packages. Most of which can be sourced from CRAN, but some must be downloaded from GitHub. We can use the following code to load in the packages and install any packages not previously installed in the R console. 

```{r, load packages, include = TRUE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, results = 'hide'}
if (!require("pacman")) install.packages("pacman")
pacman::p_load("ggplot2","officer","ggpubr", "rcompanion", "RColorBrewer", "patchwork", "magrittr","reshape2", "stringr", "plyr", "dplyr", "flextable", "tidyr", "tibble", "vegan", "paletteer", "purrr")
```

```{r}
setwd("/Users/annabelleconti/Documents/GitHub/aminoTrial/data")
getwd()

read_plus <- function(flnm) {
  read.csv(flnm) %>%
    mutate_all(as.character) %>%
    mutate(filename = flnm)
}
```

```{r}
#this converts all the csv files in the specific path into data frames 
tagData1 <-
  list.files(path = "../data/sideSeg/T3", pattern = "*.csv",
             full.names = T) %>%
  map_df(~read_plus(.)) %>%
  as.tibble()

```

```{r}
tagData1
```

```{r}
library(readr)

# Save as CSV on desktop
write_csv(tagData1, "~/Desktop/tagDataT3new.csv")


```
